# CS-230-Operating-Platforms
Repository for the Operating Platforms Class in SNHU

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The gaming room is already a successful online gaming application that is only playable on android, and they would like us to make a web-based game that is able to run on multiple devices. The game is to be called "Draw it or Lose it", some of the requirements they have is the ability to have one or more teams involved, Each team will have multiple players assigned to it, and Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name, Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I was able to effectively describe the differences in all the platforms with mac, Linux, windows, and mobile devices.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
This document allowed me to be able to organize and think out all of the choices and ideas I had in order to provide the best software to the client and allow me to sketch and illustrate to the client exactly what they would give up if they had chosen a different operating system past the one I had identified in my recommendations.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
There isn't any one area where I feel that I need to change or improve the document in, I feel as though I had done a pretty good job of illustrating the differences between the different systems and how one might be better for a specific use case.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Well, the system they wanted was a fast and secure system, I also interpreted that they would like for it to be an easy process for set up so my design followed which one required less prior knowledge of the systems in place already and how they can improve the security of that given operating system, thus windows met all of the design constraints with the ability to make it more secure later on.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I think it is important to look at the most important parts that your client wants, in this case, they wanted a fast and secure system that wouldn't want a lot of prior knowledge to be known to use the operating system effectively, in other scenarios it would be important to understand the needs and wants of the client in order to properly serve them and to allow them the greatest freedom you can give them.
